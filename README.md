# HEXDEC

A simple hexa-decimal to decimal convertor. A faster way of reading your hex dump with custom parsing by defining presets.

Presets - Allows you to define your data parsing syntax 

e.g., If your hex data is `68 3C 6D 74` and you need to parse first two bytes as one value and 3rd and 4th byte in the sequence as their own values. Then you define your preset to be `2,1,1` then the hex data will be parsed as `15464 109 116` each data in your preset parsed as little-endian by default. 

--

Hex: `68 3C 6D 74`

Preset: `2,1,1`

converts to `3C68 6D 74` => `15464 109 116`

--

Hex: `68 3C 6D 74`

Preset: `b, 2,1,1` //to treat your bytes as big-endian

`683C 6D 74` => `26684 109 116`
